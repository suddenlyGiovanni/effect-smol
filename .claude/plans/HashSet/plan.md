# HashSet Feature Port Plan

## Executive Summary

Port the immutable HashSet implementation from the full Effect library to effect-smol, building on the existing HashMap foundation. The goal is to provide a complete immutable HashSet API that complements the existing MutableHashSet, following effect-smol's established patterns and reusing HashMap as much as possible.

## Current State Analysis

### What Already Exists ✅
- **HashMap.ts**: Complete immutable HashMap implementation with HAMT data structure
- **MutableHashSet.ts**: Complete mutable hash set implementation built on MutableHashMap
- **MutableHashMap.ts**: Mutable hash map with hybrid storage
- **Hash.ts**: Core hashing infrastructure
- **Equal.ts**: Structural equality system
- **Established Patterns**: Dual API pattern, functional composition, type-level utilities

### What's Missing ❌ → ✅ NOW COMPLETED
- ✅ **Immutable HashSet**: Persistent set data structure with structural sharing
- ✅ **Advanced Set Operations**: union, intersection, difference, isSubset
- ✅ **Functional Transformations**: map, filter, reduce with immutable semantics  
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for immutable HashSet functionality (26 tests)
- ✅ **Performance Validation**: Verification of O(1) operations on top of HashMap

## Implementation Strategy: Maximum HashMap Reuse

### Core Design Philosophy
**HashSet<V> = HashMap<V, boolean>** - Store set values as HashMap keys with `true` as values

This approach maximizes code reuse and ensures:
- ✅ **Zero duplication** of HAMT implementation
- ✅ **Consistent performance** with HashMap (O(1) operations)
- ✅ **Automatic structural sharing** through HashMap's immutable operations
- ✅ **Built-in equality/hashing** through HashMap's existing mechanisms

### HashMap Integration Pattern
```typescript
// HashSet implementation leverages HashMap directly
const add = <V>(self: HashSet<V>, value: V): HashSet<V> => 
  fromHashMap(HashMap.set(toHashMap(self), value, true))

const has = <V>(self: HashSet<V>, value: V): boolean =>
  HashMap.has(toHashMap(self), value)

const remove = <V>(self: HashSet<V>, value: V): HashSet<V> =>
  fromHashMap(HashMap.remove(toHashMap(self), value))
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Data Structure
```typescript
// HashSet is a lightweight wrapper over HashMap
interface HashSet<out V> {
  readonly [TypeId]: TypeId
  /** @internal */
  readonly _keyMap: HashMap.HashMap<V, boolean>
}

// Construction helpers
const fromHashMap = <V>(keyMap: HashMap.HashMap<V, boolean>): HashSet<V>
const toHashMap = <V>(self: HashSet<V>): HashMap.HashMap<V, boolean>
```

### Performance Characteristics (Inherited from HashMap)
- **Add/Remove/Has**: O(1) average case, O(log n) worst case
- **Set Operations**: O(n) where n is size of the larger set
- **Iteration**: O(n) in deterministic order
- **Memory**: Structural sharing through HashMap's HAMT implementation

### API Design Principles
- **Dual API pattern**: Support both data-first and data-last signatures
- **Maximum reuse**: Delegate all operations to HashMap where possible
- **Type safety**: Maintain strong TypeScript inference and variance
- **Performance**: Zero overhead wrapper design
- **Consistency**: Follow existing effect-smol patterns exactly

### HashMap Operation Mapping
| HashSet Operation | HashMap Operation | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| `add(set, value)` | `set(map, value, true)` | Store value as key with `true` |
| `has(set, value)` | `has(map, value)` | Direct delegation |
| `remove(set, value)` | `remove(map, value)` | Direct delegation |
| `union(s1, s2)` | `union(m1, m2)` | Automatic boolean value merging |
| `intersection(s1, s2)` | Filter keys present in both | Custom logic needed |
| `map(set, f)` | Map keys with `fromIterable` | Transform and collect unique |
| `size(set)` | `size(map)` | Direct delegation |

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### 🚨 CRITICAL LINTING REMINDER 🚨
**NEVER FORGET**: After editing ANY TypeScript file, IMMEDIATELY run:
```bash
pnpm lint --fix <file_path>
```
This is NOT optional - it must be done after EVERY file modification!

### Pre-commit Requirements
- [ ] All tests pass: `pnpm test HashSet.test.ts`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `pnpm check`
- [ ] **MANDATORY LINTING**: `pnpm lint --fix` (MUST run after every file edit)
- [ ] Build succeeds: `pnpm build`
- [ ] Documentation examples compile: `pnpm docgen` (CRITICAL - all examples must compile)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (O(1) operations)

### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] All public APIs have comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Examples demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- [ ] Error handling follows Effect library conventions
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized through HashMap reuse
- [ ] Thread safety inherits from HashMap implementation

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (Due to HashMap Reuse)
- **Implementation complexity**: Simple wrapper over proven HashMap
- **Performance characteristics**: Inherits HashMap's validated performance
- **Memory management**: Structural sharing handled by HashMap
- **Correctness**: HashMap operations are well-tested and proven

### Medium Risk
- **API compatibility**: Ensuring exact compatibility with original Effect library
- **Set-specific operations**: intersection/difference logic requires careful implementation
- **Type inference**: Maintaining strong TypeScript type safety across transformations

### High Risk
- **Test coverage**: Must ensure comprehensive testing of all set-specific behaviors
- **Documentation completeness**: All examples must compile with `pnpm docgen`

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional completeness**: All HashSet operations from original Effect library work correctly
2. **Performance parity**: Operations maintain expected complexity (inherited from HashMap)
3. **Type safety**: Full TypeScript type inference without `any` or unsafe assertions
4. **Documentation quality**: All examples compile and demonstrate proper usage
5. **Test coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with edge cases and property-based tests
6. **Integration**: Seamless interoperability with existing effect-smol modules

## Timeline Estimate

**Estimated: 7-9 hours total** ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETED
- Phase 1 (Research): 1 hour ✅ COMPLETED
- Phase 2 (Core Implementation): 3-4 hours ✅ COMPLETED
- Phase 3 (Set Operations): 2-3 hours ✅ COMPLETED  
- Phase 4 (Testing): 2-3 hours ✅ COMPLETED
- Phase 5 (Documentation): 1-2 hours ✅ COMPLETED

**Key Advantage**: Significantly faster than HashMap implementation due to maximum reuse strategy.
