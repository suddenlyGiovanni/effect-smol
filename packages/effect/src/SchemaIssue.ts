/**
 * Structured validation errors produced by the Effect Schema system.
 *
 * When `Schema.decode`, `Schema.encode`, or a filter rejects a value, the
 * result is an {@link Issue} — a recursive tree that describes *what* went
 * wrong and *where*. This module defines every node type in that tree and
 * provides formatters that turn an `Issue` into a human-readable string or a
 * Standard Schema V1 failure result.
 *
 * ## Mental model
 *
 * - **Issue**: A discriminated union (`_tag`) of all possible validation error
 *   nodes. It is recursive — composite nodes wrap inner `Issue` children.
 * - **Leaf**: A terminal issue with no inner children ({@link InvalidType},
 *   {@link InvalidValue}, {@link MissingKey}, {@link UnexpectedKey},
 *   {@link Forbidden}, {@link OneOf}).
 * - **Composite nodes**: Wrap one or more inner issues to add context —
 *   {@link Filter}, {@link Encoding}, {@link Pointer}, {@link Composite},
 *   {@link AnyOf}.
 * - **Pointer**: Adds a property-key path to an inner issue, indicating
 *   *where* in the input the error occurred.
 * - **Formatter**: A function `Issue → Format` that serialises the error tree.
 *   Two built-in factories are provided: {@link makeFormatterDefault} (plain
 *   string) and {@link makeFormatterStandardSchemaV1} (Standard Schema V1).
 *
 * ## Common tasks
 *
 * - Check if a value is an Issue → {@link isIssue}
 * - Extract the actual input from any issue → {@link getActual}
 * - Format an issue as a string → {@link makeFormatterDefault}
 * - Format an issue for Standard Schema V1 → {@link makeFormatterStandardSchemaV1}
 * - Customise leaf formatting → {@link defaultLeafHook}
 * - Customise filter formatting → {@link defaultCheckHook}
 *
 * ## Gotchas
 *
 * - `Pointer` and `MissingKey` carry no actual value — {@link getActual}
 *   returns `Option.none()` for them.
 * - `AnyOf`, `UnexpectedKey`, `OneOf`, and `Filter` store `actual` as a plain
 *   `unknown` (not `Option`), so {@link getActual} wraps them with
 *   `Option.some`.
 * - Calling `toString()` on any `Issue` uses the default formatter. To
 *   customise output, create your own formatter with
 *   {@link makeFormatterDefault} or {@link makeFormatterStandardSchemaV1}.
 * - The `Issue` tree can be deeply nested for complex schemas. Formatters
 *   flatten composite nodes for display.
 *
 * ## Quickstart
 *
 * **Example** (Inspecting a validation error)
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Schema, SchemaIssue } from "effect"
 *
 * const Person = Schema.Struct({
 *   name: Schema.String,
 *   age: Schema.Number
 * })
 *
 * try {
 *   Schema.decodeUnknownSync(Person)({ name: 42 })
 * } catch (e) {
 *   if (Schema.isSchemaError(e)) {
 *     console.log(SchemaIssue.isIssue(e.issue))
 *     // true
 *     console.log(String(e.issue))
 *     // formatted error message
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
