/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Cause`, a data type that represents
 * the different ways an `Effect` can fail. It includes structured error handling with

 *
 * A `Cause` can represent:
 * - **Fail**: A typed, expected error that can be handled
 * - **Die**: An unrecoverable defect (like a programming error)
 * - **Interrupt**: A fiber interruption
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Cause, Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Creating different types of causes
 * const failCause = Cause.fail("Something went wrong")
 * const dieCause = Cause.die(new Error("Unexpected error"))
 * const interruptCause = Cause.interrupt(123)
 *
 * // Working with effects that can fail
 * const program = Effect.fail("user error").pipe(
 *   Effect.catchCause((cause) => {
 *     if (Cause.hasFail(cause)) {

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Deferred`, a powerful concurrency
 * primitive that represents an asynchronous variable that can be set exactly once.
 * Multiple fibers can await the same `Deferred` and will all be notified when it
 * completes.
 *
 * A `Deferred<A, E>` can be:
 * - **Completed successfully** with a value of type `A`
 * - **Failed** with an error of type `E`
 * - **Interrupted** if the fiber setting it is interrupted
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - **Single assignment**: Can only be completed once
 * - **Multiple waiters**: Many fibers can await the same `Deferred`
 * - **Fiber-safe**: Thread-safe operations across concurrent fibers
 * - **Composable**: Works seamlessly with other Effect operations
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Deferred } from "effect"
 * import { Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic usage: coordinate between fibers

/**
 * The `Effect` module is the core of the Effect library, providing a powerful and expressive
 * way to model and compose asynchronous, concurrent, and effectful computations.
 *
 * An `Effect<A, E, R>` represents a computation that:
 * - May succeed with a value of type `A`
 * - May fail with an error of type `E`
 * - Requires a context/environment of type `R`
 *
 * Effects are lazy and immutable - they describe computations that can be executed later.
 * This allows for powerful composition, error handling, resource management, and concurrency
 * patterns.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * - **Type-safe error handling**: Errors are tracked in the type system
 * - **Resource management**: Automatic cleanup with scoped resources
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Safe parallel and concurrent execution
 * - **Composable**: Effects can be combined using operators like `flatMap`, `map`, `zip`
 * - **Testable**: Built-in support for testing with controlled environments
 * - **Interruptible**: Effects can be safely interrupted and cancelled
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Console } from "effect/logging"
 *
 * // Creating a simple effect
 * const hello = Effect.succeed("Hello, World!")
 *
 * // Composing effects
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const message = yield* hello
 *   yield* Console.log(message)
 *   return message.length
 * })
 *
 * // Running the effect
 * Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log) // 13
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 *
 * // Effect that may fail
 * const divide = (a: number, b: number) =>
 *   b === 0
 *     ? Effect.fail(new Error("Division by zero"))
 *     : Effect.succeed(a / b)
 *
 * // Error handling
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const result = yield* divide(10, 2)
 *   console.log("Result:", result) // Result: 5
 *   return result
 * })
 *
 * // Handle errors
 * const safeProgram = program.pipe(
 *   Effect.match({
 *     onFailure: (error) => -1,

/**
 * This module provides utilities for working with `Fiber`, the fundamental unit of
 * concurrency in Effect. Fibers are lightweight, user-space threads that allow
 * multiple Effects to run concurrently with structured concurrency guarantees.
 *
 * Key characteristics of Fibers:
 * - **Lightweight**: Much lighter than OS threads, you can create millions
 * - **Structured concurrency**: Parent fibers manage child fiber lifecycles
 * - **Cancellation safety**: Proper resource cleanup when interrupted
 * - **Cooperative**: Fibers yield control at effect boundaries
 * - **Traceable**: Each fiber has an ID for debugging and monitoring
 *
 * Common patterns:
 * - **Fork and join**: Start concurrent work and wait for results
 * - **Race conditions**: Run multiple effects, take the first to complete
 * - **Supervision**: Monitor and restart failed fibers
 * - **Resource management**: Ensure proper cleanup on interruption
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { Console } from "effect/logging"
 * import { Fiber } from "effect"
 *
 * // Basic fiber operations
 * const basicExample = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   // Fork an effect to run concurrently
 *   const fiber = yield* Effect.fork(
 *     Effect.gen(function* () {

 *
 *   // Do other work while the fiber runs

 *
 *   // Wait for the fiber to complete
 *   const result = yield* Fiber.join(fiber)
 *   yield* Console.log(`Fiber result: ${result}`)
 * })
 *
 * // Joining multiple fibers
 * const joinExample = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const task1 = Effect.delay(Effect.succeed("task1"), "1 second")
 *   const task2 = Effect.delay(Effect.succeed("task2"), "2 seconds")
 *
 *   // Start both effects as fibers
 *   const fiber1 = yield* Effect.fork(task1)
 *   const fiber2 = yield* Effect.fork(task2)
 *
 *   // Wait for both to complete

 *   const result2 = yield* Fiber.join(fiber2)
