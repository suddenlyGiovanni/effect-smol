Fix `Atom.serializable` encode/decode for wire transfer.

Use `Schema.toCodecJson` instead of `Schema.encodeSync`/`Schema.decodeSync` directly, so that encoded values are plain JSON objects that survive serialization roundtrips (JSON, seroval, etc.). Previously, `AsyncResult.Schema` encode produced instances with custom prototypes that were lost after wire transfer, causing decode to fail with "Expected AsyncResult" errors during SSR hydration.
